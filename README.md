# virtual-camera-keyboard

This project is a virtual keyboard that uses computer vision to provide a touchless typing experience. Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, it tracks your hand gestures in real-time to translate "air-taps" into typed text. It's a great example of a practical human-computer interface built with modern computer vision techniques.
